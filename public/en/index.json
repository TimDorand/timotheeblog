[{"content":"I’m Jan Astasia, member of Radio Sofa, a web radio based in Paris and resident at THF Radio in Berlin. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently hosted a workshop at TNP Radio\u0026rsquo;s event in Amsterdam and I wanted to share what I gathered.\nOnline radio stations are musical playgrounds for both upcoming and established talent. But anyone who has been closely following the established platforms like NTS, Kiosk Radio, or Radio TNP will agree that these platforms represent much more. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how online radio platforms can make a positive impact on the world.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at examples of impactful projects done by radio stations across the world.\nExamples of Impactful Projects Geo-Political Debates Genocide in Gaza / Assault in Lebanon LOT Radio: Organized the \u0026ldquo;Resistance Stream\u0026rdquo; to support Palestine Mutual Aid 1 2.\nRadio alHara: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change 3 4 The mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation is a 12 hours sound program created from content downloaded from Youtube “interweaving songs, poems, music, chants, talks, discussions, presentations, and conversations by many, many singers, intellectuals, academics, researchers, musicians, students, and fighters to teach, tell, inform, and to understand the history, the present, and reality of the ongoing struggle for justice and liberation for Palestine” 5liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine) Operator Radio Rotterdam: Asking for help for a demonstration 6 7.

In Brazil we helped build a football school by raising over €28k. We did campaigns to motivate the younger generation to vote during elections. Recently we also did a radio workshop for refugees.\nRoot Radio: Calling for a strike for all musicians 9 Invasion of Ukraine Refuge Worldwide: From solidarity party series to community radio(https://refugeworldwide.com/). Refuge was started as a fundraising platform working in solidarity with grassroots and non-profit organisations. In January 2021 we launched Refuge Worldwide, a new radio station to amplify the music and issues that we care about, broadcasting 24/7 from Weserstraße 166, (12045 Berlin Neukölln). Reminiscing Our Land: A fundraiser by Root Radio \u0026amp; Refuge Worldwide 10\nOn November 2nd 2024, Root Radio and Refuge Worldwide will once again collaborate on an event to raise funds for the ongoing assault on Lebanon and Gaza. The event, which takes place at a secret \u0026ldquo;multidisciplinary venue\u0026rdquo; in Berlin, also aims to provide a space for collective reflection and raising awareness. Over 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes, and thousands killed, since Israel has escalated its attacks on Lebanon throughout the past month. Lebanon is now suffering from a nationwide humanitarian crisis, while the situation in neighbouring Palestine also continues to worsen each day. Starting from 3PM and running until 2AM, Reminiscing Our Land will feature a number of live performances and listening sessions, as well as an art market, food and a screening of On Thyme Hills (a documentary about resistant ecologies in London, Lebanon, and Palestine). Musical contributions come from Abadir, Nour Sokhon, Dakn, Peter Kirn, Q, Marylou, Lateef \u0026amp; VEX, Joumana, Sunfear \u0026amp; Lawrence Goodwin, Aalia \u0026amp; Azemad, and Root Radio founder Ahmadshk. The arts and merch sale will include pieces from Aliaa Kurdi, Hildashaus, Sina Opalka, Space Of Urgency, Suhail Nassar + Moayed Abu Ammouna and Diaspora Rising, as well as a vinyl sale organised by Refuge and its resident artists. Entry will be by donation - minimum 10€ is suggested - but nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. All proceeds from the event will be donated to a small number of trusted groups working on the ground in Lebanon and Palestine, including a trusted individual facilitating aid and ambulance visits, and organisations supporting migrant workers in Lebanon.

We believe that music is an instrument of peace, a medicine, whose power can be felt by everyone and can help to find faith, hope, and peace in this world again. We invite artists from all over the world to sow grains of peace to support the spirit of our country, fill souls with light, and fill the future with meaning.

Eventually, we joined forces with Standard Deviation, the Modern Matters agency and others. Everyone was keen to get involved. It was probably the best thing I could have done during this time, and I am very proud of this project.”\nCafé Político Radio: Based in Colombia, this station discusses Latin American politics, including regional geopolitical developments1.\nEye on Global Politics: A US-based station focusing on international political affairs, providing in-depth analysis of global issues1.\nNTS: Hosted a \u0026ldquo;musique de silence\u0026rdquo; event in solidarity with the genocide in Gaza. 21 18th December is International Migrants Day - an annual day recognising the lives and contributions of migrants around the world.

Front électronique: Involved in political debates during French legislative elections.\nIn preparation for the legislative elections, a movement in the electronic music industry was created, the Electronic Front, to respond with one voice to the rise of the extreme right. The movement brings together 38 artists in the compilation “Siamo Tutti Antifascti”, which is above all a call for mobilization. Faced with an ideology that threatens the independence of the cultural sector and individual freedoms, the Electronist Front recalls that the defence of freedoms through artistic creation will never die.\nEmpowering Local Communities Root Radio (Istanbul): Broadcasts feminist content. Root Radio (Istanbul) : Feminist March Broadcast. Saluting the womxn who are fighting for equitable futures and honoring 8 March week as we did in the last years with beautiful and powerful voices of Root’s women \u0026amp; non-binary residents.

Our activities have now expanded to include traditional radio broadcasting, production of festive and meditative events, visual arts, and micro-collections of clothing and cassettes.\nRadio Sofa creates a space of expression for artists and discovery for the audience. We are committed to pioneering and inclusive programming, showcasing emerging artists with diverse identities and valuing risk-taking and creation.

Sustainable World Radio: Focuses on ecology, permaculture, and regenerative farming.\nPDF Presentation Take a look at the Presentation PDF with visual examples\nConclusion What can we do as Media or Radio Platform? Here are some meaningful actions you can take to address societal issues or challenges.\nEmpower Local Communities Create a new show hosted by Radio Team Promote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote) Give a voice to minorities\nFind a journalist to create a residency Show a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture\nActivism: Education before Fund Raising Share more Educational content Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money It\u0026rsquo;s important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time.\nActivism: Freedom of Speech Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.\nUse the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities If they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice\nCreate or be a relay for content Help people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start. Who should they trust? Who\u0026rsquo;s really independent - saying the truth?\nFinance the Radio Studio / Station Public funding How to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things.\nSelf-funding Try not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events.\nReferences Date: March 13th 2025 Author: Timothée Dorand Telegram/Insta/Soundcloud: @janastasiamusic Instagram - Resistance Stream\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nInstagram - Kraejiyaeji\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: www.radioalhara.net/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisite website: soundcloud.com/radiokarantina/until-liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: operator-radio.com\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: soundcloud.com/operator-radio.

All of this without a bread maker!\nIngredients for a 1 kg bread 580g of organic T65 flour 430g of spring water 12g of salt 300g of sourdough or 25g of dehydrated yeast This makes a bread dough with 74% water content.\nKneading by hand 30 min - turn (lift dough on itself with wet hand) 3h - shaping 3h - flouring and baking For a 40% smaller loaf\n350g flour 258g water 8g of salt Baking T his is the most important step to finish our homemade bread. The best way to do this is to place the floured bread in a cast iron (or Dutch oven) pot that has been placed in the oven. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a cast iron pot, so I use two Pyrex dishes that fit together.\nAlternatively, you can put the bread on a baking sheet and place a pan full of water in the bottom of the oven.\nThe goal is to keep the bread moist enough during the baking process so that it can rise slowly. Wholemeal bread You can also mix flours, I advise to try buckwheat, rye, spelt flour. The wholemeal bread rises less, but it will be rich in fiber.\n","permalink":"/en/posts/pain_maison/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter several attempts and dozens of bakings, I present you my favorite recipe.
