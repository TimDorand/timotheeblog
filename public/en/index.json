[{"content":"I’m Jan Astasia, member of Radio Sofa, a web radio based in Paris and resident at THF Radio in Berlin. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently hosted a workshop at TNP Radio\u0026rsquo;s event in Amsterdam and I wanted to share what I gathered.\nOnline radio stations are musical playgrounds for both upcoming and established talent. But anyone who has been closely following the established platforms like NTS, Kiosk Radio, or Radio TNP will agree that these platforms represent much more. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how online radio platforms can make a positive impact on the world.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at examples of impactful projects done by radio stations across the world.\nExamples of Impactful Projects Geo-Political Debates Genocide in Gaza / Assault in Lebanon LOT Radio: Organized the \u0026ldquo;Resistance Stream\u0026rdquo; to support Palestine Mutual Aid 1 2.\nRadio alHara: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change 3 4 The mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation is a 12 hours sound program created from content downloaded from Youtube “interweaving songs, poems, music, chants, talks, discussions, presentations, and conversations by many, many singers, intellectuals, academics, researchers, musicians, students, and fighters to teach, tell, inform, and to understand the history, the present, and reality of the ongoing struggle for justice and liberation for Palestine” 5liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine) Operator Radio Rotterdam: Asking for help for a demonstration 6 7.

In Brazil we helped build a football school by raising over €28k. We did campaigns to motivate the younger generation to vote during elections. Recently we also did a radio workshop for refugees.\nRoot Radio: Calling for a strike for all musicians 9 Invasion of Ukraine Refuge Worldwide: From solidarity party series to community radio(https://refugeworldwide.com/). Refuge was started as a fundraising platform working in solidarity with grassroots and non-profit organisations. In January 2021 we launched Refuge Worldwide, a new radio station to amplify the music and issues that we care about, broadcasting 24/7 from Weserstraße 166, (12045 Berlin Neukölln). Reminiscing Our Land: A fundraiser by Root Radio \u0026amp; Refuge Worldwide 10\nOn November 2nd 2024, Root Radio and Refuge Worldwide will once again collaborate on an event to raise funds for the ongoing assault on Lebanon and Gaza. The event, which takes place at a secret \u0026ldquo;multidisciplinary venue\u0026rdquo; in Berlin, also aims to provide a space for collective reflection and raising awareness. Over 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes, and thousands killed, since Israel has escalated its attacks on Lebanon throughout the past month. Lebanon is now suffering from a nationwide humanitarian crisis, while the situation in neighbouring Palestine also continues to worsen each day. Starting from 3PM and running until 2AM, Reminiscing Our Land will feature a number of live performances and listening sessions, as well as an art market, food and a screening of On Thyme Hills (a documentary about resistant ecologies in London, Lebanon, and Palestine). Musical contributions come from Abadir, Nour Sokhon, Dakn, Peter Kirn, Q, Marylou, Lateef \u0026amp; VEX, Joumana, Sunfear \u0026amp; Lawrence Goodwin, Aalia \u0026amp; Azemad, and Root Radio founder Ahmadshk. The arts and merch sale will include pieces from Aliaa Kurdi, Hildashaus, Sina Opalka, Space Of Urgency, Suhail Nassar + Moayed Abu Ammouna and Diaspora Rising, as well as a vinyl sale organised by Refuge and its resident artists. Entry will be by donation - minimum 10€ is suggested - but nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. All proceeds from the event will be donated to a small number of trusted groups working on the ground in Lebanon and Palestine, including a trusted individual facilitating aid and ambulance visits, and organisations supporting migrant workers in Lebanon.

Eventually, we joined forces with Standard Deviation, the Modern Matters agency and others. Everyone was keen to get involved. It was probably the best thing I could have done during this time, and I am very proud of this project.”\nCafé Político Radio: Based in Colombia, this station discusses Latin American politics, including regional geopolitical developments1.\nEye on Global Politics: A US-based station focusing on international political affairs, providing in-depth analysis of global issues1.\nNTS: Hosted a \u0026ldquo;musique de silence\u0026rdquo; event in solidarity with the genocide in Gaza. 21 18th December is International Migrants Day - an annual day recognising the lives and contributions of migrants around the world.

Here are some meaningful actions you can take to address societal issues or challenges.\nEmpower Local Communities Create a new show hosted by Radio Team Promote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote) Give a voice to minorities\nFind a journalist to create a residency Show a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture\nActivism: Education before Fund Raising Share more Educational content Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money It\u0026rsquo;s important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time.\nActivism: Freedom of Speech Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.\nUse the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities If they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice\nCreate or be a relay for content Help people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start. Who should they trust? Who\u0026rsquo;s really independent - saying the truth?\nFinance the Radio Studio / Station Public funding How to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things.\nSelf-funding Try not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events.\nReferences Date: March 13th 2025 Author: Timothée Dorand Telegram/Insta/Soundcloud: @janastasiamusic Instagram - Resistance Stream\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nInstagram - Kraejiyaeji\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: www.radioalhara.net/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisite website: soundcloud.com/radiokarantina/until-liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: operator-radio.com\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: soundcloud.com/operator-radio.

From the golden age of rumba and soukous to modern electronic and afro-punk fusions, the episode highlights both the roots and the future of African drums.

The capitals, Kinshasa and Brazzaville, sit across from each other on the Congo River, making them the world’s closest capitals. Cultural \u0026amp; Musical Roots:\nDespite shared ethnic groups and river, each country developed distinct musical identities due to their colonial histories and economic differences.\nThe DRC is famed for its mineral wealth and musical innovation, while Congo-Brazzaville is known for oil and vibrant urban culture. Musical Evolution: 1940s–60s: The birth and golden age of Congolese rumba, with artists like Wendo Kolosoy, Joseph Kabasele (Grand Kallé), African Jazz, and OK Jazz (Franco Luambo, Vicky Longomba). 1970s–90s: Big bands (Zaïko, Stukas), the rise of soukous, and political changes affecting music scenes. Modern Era: Contemporary artists like Fally Ipupa and Ferre Gola continue to innovate, while genres like soukous, ndombolo, and electronic fusions thrive. Influences \u0026amp; Connections Pan-African \u0026amp; Global:\nCongolese music has influenced and been influenced by Benga (Kenya), Champeta (Colombia), and funk, jazz, and electronic music worldwide. Women in Tradition:\nStella Chiweshe broke gender barriers as Africa’s most famous female mbira player, blending Zimbabwean tradition with global sounds. Percussion Power:\nLes Tambours de Brazza (Congo-Brazzaville) blend traditional ngoma drums with modern instruments, representing the region’s rhythmic diversity. Highlife \u0026amp; Afrobeat:\nEbo Taylor (Ghana) and Oghene Kologbo (Nigeria) show the cross-pollination of West African highlife, afrobeat, and Congolese rumba.

Here’s how I did it.\nData Storage Probably the most useful tool in my daily life was Google Drive’s cloud. 15GB of free data, synced to my computer and instantly accessible from my phone.\nInstead of sending my photos and files to a data center, I decided to host my own NAS. I set up 16TB of data on a Synology NAS with 4 hard drives. Thanks to the latest data replication technology, I can lose a drive without losing a single file. This costs me about 15% of the total space, but gives me real peace of mind.\nSynology has done a great job with connectivity for its iOS and Android apps. I can now access my 2TB of photos and videos remotely, and automatically sync all my latest photos thanks to the Synology Photos app.\nOther apps are available on the marketplace, like Synology Calendar, which also syncs with iOS.\nCost: €700\nTools replaced: Google Drive, Google Photos\nSearch Engine Google’s powerful search engine needs no introduction. After months of trying the competition (DuckDuckGo, Ecosia) I settled on Qwant. The results get better every day. To go with it, I use Firefox on both desktop and mobile. It’s fast and very effective at blocking tracking requests.\nTracking We use a lot of online software for free, without worrying about how our data is handled. Tracking allows companies to collect juicy information to resell to interested parties. This includes your web searches, messages with friends, sites you’ve visited, videos you’ve watched, and even how long you looked at an Instagram post.\nAddress books are sold at a premium to advertisers for targeted campaigns.\nThere are privacy-respecting tools (Firefox, Qwant), but to really browse safely, you need blockers. These apps block a whole list of requests so they never leave your device.\nThe best-known is \u0026ldquo;Lockdown,\u0026rdquo; which works on browsers and apps (iOS and Android).\nEmail To finish with Google, I deleted all my emails from Gmail and switched to an OVH mailbox with the Spark client. Firefox Relay is also very convinient not to share your public email to all the website you signup to.\nMaps The winner is Here We Go, a fantastic app that lets you generate well-designed offline routes—even for cycling!\nCalendar Goodbye Google Calendar. For two years now, I never go anywhere without my pocket calendar and a little pencil.\nTo be continued\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"/en/posts/technology_alternatives_for_google/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe GAFA empire is sprawling.

All of this without a bread maker!\nIngredients for a 1 kg bread 580g of organic T65 flour 430g of spring water 12g of salt 300g of sourdough or 25g of dehydrated yeast This makes a bread dough with 74% water content.\nKneading by hand 30 min - turn (lift dough on itself with wet hand) 3h - shaping 3h - flouring and baking For a 40% smaller loaf\n350g flour 258g water 8g of salt Baking T his is the most important step to finish our homemade bread. The best way to do this is to place the floured bread in a cast iron (or Dutch oven) pot that has been placed in the oven. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a cast iron pot, so I use two Pyrex dishes that fit together.\nAlternatively, you can put the bread on a baking sheet and place a pan full of water in the bottom of the oven.\nThe goal is to keep the bread moist enough during the baking process so that it can rise slowly. Wholemeal bread You can also mix flours, I advise to try buckwheat, rye, spelt flour. The wholemeal bread rises less, but it will be rich in fiber.\n","permalink":"/en/posts/pain_maison/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter several attempts and dozens of bakings, I present you my favorite recipe.
