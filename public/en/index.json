I\u0026rsquo;ve recently hosted a workshop at TNP Radio\u0026rsquo;s event in Amsterdam and I wanted to share what I gathered.\nMaking a Positive Impact on the World with an Online Radio Platform Online radio stations are musical playgrounds for both upcoming and established talent. But anyone who has been closely following the established platforms like NTS, Kiosk Radio, or Radio TNP will agree that these platforms represent much more. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how online radio platforms can make a positive impact on the world.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at examples of impactful projects done by radio stations across the world.\nExamples of Impactful Projects Geo-Political Debates NTS: Hosted a \u0026ldquo;musique de silence\u0026rdquo; event in solidarity with the genocide in Gaza. HÖR: Controversially censored pro-Palestine apparel. LOT Radio: Organized the \u0026ldquo;Resistance Stream\u0026rdquo; to support Palestine Mutual Aid. Radio alHara: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change. Refuge Worldwide \u0026amp; Root Radio: Fundraisers for Lebanon and Gaza. Invasion of Ukraine Refuge Worldwide: Transitioned from solidarity parties to a community radio station. Radio Vilnius: Platform featuring Ukrainian experimental and underground music. Gasoline Radio: Promotes Ukrainian culture. 20ftradio: Independent music radio in Kyiv. Grains of Peace: Supports Ukraine through music. Mystictrax: Ukrainian experimental sound laboratory. Relief and Humanitarian Aid Root Radio \u0026amp; Metamorphosen: Donation-based event for families affected by the earthquake in Syria. Nile FM (Internews): Provides critical information to communities in crisis. First Response Radio: Sets up radio stations within 72 hours of a disaster. Local Politics and Issues Mutant Radio: Engages in local political debates. Root Radio: Active in local issues and debates. Reset! Network: Supports independent cultural and media organizations in Europe. Front électronique: Involved in political debates during French legislative elections. Empowering Local Communities Root Radio (Istanbul): Broadcasts feminist content. Radio Vacarme: Focuses on women and gender minorities. Rinse: Hosts Queer Cult takeovers.

Sustainable World Radio: Focuses on ecology, permaculture, and regenerative farming. Take a look at the Presentation PDF with visual examples\nGroup Workshop Meaningful ideas to address societal issues or challenges Empower Local Communities Create a new show hosted by Radio Team\nPromote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote) Give a voice to minorities Find a journalist to create a residency\nShow a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture Activism: Education before Fund Raising Share more Educational content Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money It\u0026rsquo;s important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time. Activism: Freedom of Speech Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.\nUse the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities\nIf they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice Create or be a relay for content\nHelp people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start. Who should they trust? Who\u0026rsquo;s really independent - saying the truth? Finance the Radio Studio / Station Public funding\nHow to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things. Self-funding\nTry not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events. Date March 13th 2025 Author: Timothée Dorand Telegram/Insta/Soundcloud: @janastasiamusic\nIntroduction to Radio Sofa Radio Sofa is a collective set up in April 2020, originally as a web radio station. The idea was to continue broadcasting current and electronic music while cultural venues had to stay silent. Our activities have now expanded to include traditional radio broadcasting, production of festive and meditative events, visual arts, and micro-collections of clothing and cassettes.\nMission and Values Radio Sofa creates a space of expression for artists and discovery for the audience. We are committed to pioneering and inclusive programming, showcasing emerging artists with diverse identities and valuing risk-taking and creation. We also aim to minimize the environmental impact of our activities by programming local artists and prioritizing soft mobility and second-hand materials.\n","permalink":"/en/posts/making-impact-as-webradio/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m Jan Astasia, member of Radio Sofa, a web radio based in Paris and resident at THF Radio in Berlin.

Woob: is the stage name of Paul Frankland, an English composer, musician and filmmaker who started recording in the early 1990s. Woob\u0026rsquo;s albums combine elements of ambient, downtempo and space music, with samples from field recordings. Frankland has also recorded under the names of Journeyman and Max \u0026amp; Harvey. Adham Shaikh is a composer, record producer and sound designer living near Nelson, British Columbia. The 21st-century rituals of dance and chill-out have drawn Shaikh to explore the trance phenomenon that these different expressions of music create and allow. Over the years, Shaikh has worked with musicians playing musical instruments from India; Bali, Indonesia; Africa; Scandinavia; Turkey; the United States; and Canada. Muslimgauze was the main musical project of Bryn Jones (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British ethnic electronica and experimental musician who was influenced by conflicts and history in the Muslim world, often with an emphasis on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never achieved mainstream success. His music has been described by one critic as \u0026ldquo;among the most startling and unique in the noise underground. Jonaz Joslen: Martinique: sound designer, beatmaker composer and songwriter, also director of documentaries from french caribbean.

All of this without a bread maker!\nIngredients for a 1 kg bread 580g of organic T65 flour 430g of spring water 12g of salt 300g of sourdough or 25g of dehydrated yeast This makes a bread dough with 74% water content.\nKneading by hand 30 min - turn (lift dough on itself with wet hand) 3h - shaping 3h - flouring and baking For a 40% smaller loaf\n350g flour 258g water 8g of salt Baking This is the most important step to finish our homemade bread. The best way to do this is to place the floured bread in a cast iron (or Dutch oven) pot that has been placed in the oven. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a cast iron pot, so I use two Pyrex dishes that fit together.\nAlternatively, you can put the bread on a baking sheet and place a pan full of water in the bottom of the oven.\nThe goal is to keep the bread moist enough during the baking process so that it can rise slowly. Wholemeal bread You can also mix flours, I advise to try buckwheat, rye, spelt flour.
