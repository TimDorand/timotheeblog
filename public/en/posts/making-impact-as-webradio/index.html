I’ve recently hosted a workshop at TNP Radio’s event in Amsterdam and I wanted to share what I gathered.\nMaking a Positive Impact on the World with an Online Radio Platform Online radio stations are musical playgrounds for both upcoming and established talent. But anyone who has been closely following the established platforms like NTS, Kiosk Radio, or Radio TNP will agree that these platforms represent much more. In this article, we’ll discuss how online radio platforms can make a positive impact on the world.\nFirst, let’s take a look at examples of impactful projects done by radio stations across the world.\nExamples of Impactful Projects Geo-Political Debates NTS: Hosted a “musique de silence” event in solidarity with the genocide in Gaza. HÖR: Controversially censored pro-Palestine apparel. LOT Radio: Organized the “Resistance Stream” to support Palestine Mutual Aid. Radio alHara: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change. Refuge Worldwide \u0026 Root Radio: Fundraisers for Lebanon and Gaza. Invasion of Ukraine Refuge Worldwide: Transitioned from solidarity parties to a community radio station. Radio Vilnius: Platform featuring Ukrainian experimental and underground music. Gasoline Radio: Promotes Ukrainian culture. 20ftradio: Independent music radio in Kyiv. Grains of Peace: Supports Ukraine through music. Mystictrax: Ukrainian experimental sound laboratory. Relief and Humanitarian Aid Root Radio \u0026 Metamorphosen: Donation-based event for families affected by the earthquake in Syria. Nile FM (Internews): Provides critical information to communities in crisis. First Response Radio: Sets up radio stations within 72 hours of a disaster. Local Politics and Issues Mutant Radio: Engages in local political debates. Root Radio: Active in local issues and debates. Reset! Network: Supports independent cultural and media organizations in Europe. Front électronique: Involved in political debates during French legislative elections. Empowering Local Communities Root Radio (Istanbul): Broadcasts feminist content. Radio Vacarme: Focuses on women and gender minorities. Rinse: Hosts Queer Cult takeovers. Lyl Radio: Promotes local culture in Paris. Refuge Worldwide: Uses its platform to relay important community messages. Radio Garden: Connects communities and groups living abroad. Radio Ada: Provides a platform for local talent. Promoting Sustainability Radio Sofa: Upcycles clothes, promoting sustainable fashion. iHeartRadio Earth: Encourages sustainable actions. Sustainable World Radio: Focuses on ecology, permaculture, and regenerative farming. Take a look at the Presentation PDF with visual examples\nGroup Workshop Meaningful ideas to address societal issues or challenges Empower Local Communities Create a new show hosted by Radio Team\nPromote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote) Give a voice to minorities Find a journalist to create a residency\nShow a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture Activism: Education before Fund Raising Share more Educational content Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money It’s important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time. Activism: Freedom of Speech Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.\nUse the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities\nIf they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice Create or be a relay for content\nHelp people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don’t know where to start. Who should they trust? Who’s really independent - saying the truth? Finance the Radio Studio / Station Public funding\nHow to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things. Self-funding\nTry not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events. Date March 13th 2025 Author: Timothée Dorand Telegram/Insta/Soundcloud: @janastasiamusic\nIntroduction to Radio Sofa Radio Sofa is a collective set up in April 2020, originally as a web radio station. The idea was to continue broadcasting current and electronic music while cultural venues had to stay silent. Our activities have now expanded to include traditional radio broadcasting, production of festive and meditative events, visual arts, and micro-collections of clothing and cassettes.\nMission and Values Radio Sofa creates a space of expression for artists and discovery for the audience. We are committed to pioneering and inclusive programming, showcasing emerging artists with diverse identities and valuing risk-taking and creation. We also aim to minimize the environmental impact of our activities by programming local artists and prioritizing soft mobility and second-hand materials.\n",
