[{"content":"Je suis Jan Astasia, membre de Radio Sofa, une webradio basée à Paris et résidente de THF Radio à Berlin. J\u0026rsquo;ai récemment animé un atelier lors de l\u0026rsquo;événement de TNP Radio à Amsterdam et je voulais partager ce que j\u0026rsquo;ai appris.\nLes stations de radio en ligne sont des terrains de jeu musicaux pour les talents émergents et confirmés. Mais tous ceux qui ont suivi de près les plateformes établies telles que NTS, Kiosk Radio ou Radio TNP conviendront que ces plateformes représentent bien plus. Dans cet article, nous verrons comment les plateformes de radio en ligne peuvent avoir un impact positif sur le monde.\nTout d\u0026rsquo;abord, jetons un coup d\u0026rsquo;œil sur des exemples de projets à fort impact réalisés par des stations de radio à travers le monde.\nExamples of Impactful Projects Geo-Political Debates Genocide in Gaza / Assault in Lebanon LOT Radio: Organized the \u0026ldquo;Resistance Stream\u0026rdquo; to support Palestine Mutual Aid 1 2.\nRadio alHara: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change 3 4 The mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation is a 12 hours sound program created from content downloaded from Youtube “interweaving songs, poems, music, chants, talks, discussions, presentations, and conversations by many, many singers, intellectuals, academics, researchers, musicians, students, and fighters to teach, tell, inform, and to understand the history, the present, and reality of the ongoing struggle for justice and liberation for Palestine” 5liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine) Operator Radio Rotterdam: Asking for help for a demonstration 6 7.

In Brazil we helped build a football school by raising over €28k. We did campaigns to motivate the younger generation to vote during elections. Recently we also did a radio workshop for refugees.\nRoot Radio: Calling for a strike for all musicians 9 Invasion of Ukraine Refuge Worldwide: From solidarity party series to community radio(https://refugeworldwide.com/). Refuge was started as a fundraising platform working in solidarity with grassroots and non-profit organisations. In January 2021 we launched Refuge Worldwide, a new radio station to amplify the music and issues that we care about, broadcasting 24/7 from Weserstraße 166, (12045 Berlin Neukölln). Reminiscing Our Land: A fundraiser by Root Radio \u0026amp; Refuge Worldwide 10\nOn November 2nd 2024, Root Radio and Refuge Worldwide will once again collaborate on an event to raise funds for the ongoing assault on Lebanon and Gaza. The event, which takes place at a secret \u0026ldquo;multidisciplinary venue\u0026rdquo; in Berlin, also aims to provide a space for collective reflection and raising awareness. Over 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes, and thousands killed, since Israel has escalated its attacks on Lebanon throughout the past month. Lebanon is now suffering from a nationwide humanitarian crisis, while the situation in neighbouring Palestine also continues to worsen each day. Starting from 3PM and running until 2AM, Reminiscing Our Land will feature a number of live performances and listening sessions, as well as an art market, food and a screening of On Thyme Hills (a documentary about resistant ecologies in London, Lebanon, and Palestine). Musical contributions come from Abadir, Nour Sokhon, Dakn, Peter Kirn, Q, Marylou, Lateef \u0026amp; VEX, Joumana, Sunfear \u0026amp; Lawrence Goodwin, Aalia \u0026amp; Azemad, and Root Radio founder Ahmadshk. The arts and merch sale will include pieces from Aliaa Kurdi, Hildashaus, Sina Opalka, Space Of Urgency, Suhail Nassar + Moayed Abu Ammouna and Diaspora Rising, as well as a vinyl sale organised by Refuge and its resident artists. Entry will be by donation - minimum 10€ is suggested - but nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. All proceeds from the event will be donated to a small number of trusted groups working on the ground in Lebanon and Palestine, including a trusted individual facilitating aid and ambulance visits, and organisations supporting migrant workers in Lebanon.

We invite artists from all over the world to sow grains of peace to support the spirit of our country, fill souls with light, and fill the future with meaning.

Eventually, we joined forces with Standard Deviation, the Modern Matters agency and others. Everyone was keen to get involved. It was probably the best thing I could have done during this time, and I am very proud of this project.”\nCafé Político Radio: Based in Colombia, this station discusses Latin American politics, including regional geopolitical developments1.\nEye on Global Politics: A US-based station focusing on international political affairs, providing in-depth analysis of global issues1.\nNTS: Hosted a \u0026ldquo;musique de silence\u0026rdquo; event in solidarity with the genocide in Gaza. 21 18th December is International Migrants Day - an annual day recognising the lives and contributions of migrants around the world.

Front électronique: Involved in political debates during French legislative elections.\nIn preparation for the legislative elections, a movement in the electronic music industry was created, the Electronic Front, to respond with one voice to the rise of the extreme right. The movement brings together 38 artists in the compilation “Siamo Tutti Antifascti”, which is above all a call for mobilization. Faced with an ideology that threatens the independence of the cultural sector and individual freedoms, the Electronist Front recalls that the defence of freedoms through artistic creation will never die.\nEmpowering Local Communities Root Radio (Istanbul): Broadcasts feminist content. Root Radio (Istanbul) : Feminist March Broadcast. Saluting the womxn who are fighting for equitable futures and honoring 8 March week as we did in the last years with beautiful and powerful voices of Root’s women \u0026amp; non-binary residents.

Our activities have now expanded to include traditional radio broadcasting, production of festive and meditative events, visual arts, and micro-collections of clothing and cassettes.\nRadio Sofa creates a space of expression for artists and discovery for the audience. We are committed to pioneering and inclusive programming, showcasing emerging artists with diverse identities and valuing risk-taking and creation.

Sustainable World Radio: Focuses on ecology, permaculture, and regenerative farming.\nPDF Presentation Take a look at the Presentation PDF with visual examples\nConclusion What can we do as Media or Radio Platform? Here are some meaningful actions you can take to address societal issues or challenges.\nEmpower Local Communities Create a new show hosted by Radio Team Promote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote) Give a voice to minorities\nFind a journalist to create a residency Show a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture\nActivism: Education before Fund Raising Share more Educational content Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money It\u0026rsquo;s important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time.\nActivism: Freedom of Speech Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.\nUse the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities If they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice\nCreate or be a relay for content Help people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start. Who should they trust? Who\u0026rsquo;s really independent - saying the truth?\nFinance the Radio Studio / Station Public funding How to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things.\nSelf-funding Try not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events.\nReferences Date: March 13th 2025 Author: Timothée Dorand Telegram/Insta/Soundcloud: @janastasiamusic Instagram - Resistance Stream\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nInstagram - Kraejiyaeji\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: www.radioalhara.net/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisite website: soundcloud.com/radiokarantina/until-liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: operator-radio.com\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVisit website: soundcloud.com/operator-radio.

Les capitales, Kinshasa et Brazzaville, se font face de part et d’autre du fleuve Congo, ce qui en fait les capitales les plus proches du monde. Racines culturelles \u0026amp; musicales :\nMalgré des groupes ethniques et un fleuve communs, chaque pays a développé une identité musicale distincte, influencée par son histoire coloniale et ses différences économiques.\nLa RDC est reconnue pour sa richesse minière et son innovation musicale, tandis que le Congo-Brazzaville est marqué par le pétrole et une culture urbaine dynamique. Évolution musicale : Années 1940–60 : Naissance et âge d’or de la rumba congolaise, avec des artistes comme Wendo Kolosoy, Joseph Kabasele (Grand Kallé), African Jazz, et OK Jazz (Franco Luambo, Vicky Longomba). Années 1970–90 : Big bands (Zaïko, Stukas), essor du soukous, et bouleversements politiques. Époque contemporaine : Des artistes comme Fally Ipupa et Ferre Gola innovent encore, tandis que soukous, ndombolo et fusions électroniques prospèrent. Influences \u0026amp; Connexions Pan-africain \u0026amp; global :\nLa musique congolaise a influencé et a été influencée par le Benga (Kenya), la Champeta (Colombie), le funk, le jazz et la musique électronique à travers le monde.

Puissance des percussions :\nLes Tambours de Brazza (Congo-Brazzaville) mélangent les tambours ngoma traditionnels à des instruments modernes, illustrant la diversité rythmique de la région.

C\u0026rsquo;est ce qui m\u0026rsquo;arrivait régulièrement à la fin de l\u0026rsquo;année 2021. Les messageries instantanées créaient une sur-sollicitation mentale qui aboutissait à débordement d\u0026rsquo;idées. Je devenais alors incapable de me concentrer, de faire la part des choses et de clairement identifier les différentes tâches que j\u0026rsquo;avais à faire afin de les prioriser.\nLa norme en 2021 voulait que tout le monde soit disponible en temps réel sur les messageries telles que Messenger ou Whatsapp. Nous sommes attachés avec une chaîne invisible - internet - à un boulet technologique qui requiert toute notre attention.\nEn plus de monopoliser notre concentration, l\u0026rsquo;habitude de consulter ses messages, les nouvelles vidéos postées par les amis, s\u0026rsquo;inscrit et s\u0026rsquo;enracine dans notre quotidien. Nous sommes constamment dérangés par l\u0026rsquo;envie de savoir ce qui se passe. Comme si consulter les dernières photos postées il y a une heure nous permettait d\u0026rsquo;exister. Comme une commère au marché, connaître cette information nous donne une place dans la société.\nCouper le cordon Le plan était tout vu, j\u0026rsquo;allais couper court à toutes les technologies de l\u0026rsquo;instantané afin de me concentrer sur le réel, pouvoir profiter de mon environnement, l\u0026rsquo;observer et même m\u0026rsquo;ennuyer. Je voulais retrouver ces idées qui parcourent l\u0026rsquo;esprit quand on n\u0026rsquo;a rien à faire.\nAprès plusieurs essais, avec un téléphone des années 2000 et un ipod en poche, j\u0026rsquo;ai fini par utiliser à nouveau mon smartphone, qui est un concentré de tous les outils dont j\u0026rsquo;ai besoin, mais sans abonnement internet. Depuis janvier 2021, je ne communique plus que par SMS dès que je suis à l\u0026rsquo;extérieur.\nC\u0026rsquo;est comme si je ne pouvais consulter mes messages qu\u0026rsquo;à la maison, comme mon courrier finalement. Certes j\u0026rsquo;ai dû m\u0026rsquo;adapter, préparer mes trajets, télécharger les cartes, la musique, les podcasts et les documentaires hors-ligne.\nMalgré tout, même après plus de 2 ans de contraintes, je crois que c\u0026rsquo;est la meilleure décision que j\u0026rsquo;ai prise cette année là.\nRetour d\u0026rsquo;expérience, 4 ans plus tard Nous sommes en 2026, suite à un appel avec ma soeur, elle m\u0026rsquo;a suggéré de compléter cet article avec mon retour d\u0026rsquo;expérience et mon lien avec le numérique 4 ans plus tard.\nPour être tout à fait honnête, une grande part de la tempête mentale que j\u0026rsquo;ai éprouvé au début des années 2020 était due au fait que j\u0026rsquo;habitais à Paris. Ville extraordinaire et palpitante mais aussi archi dense et fatiguante à tout point de vue. Déménager à Berlin a été un vrai soulagement à ce niveau la. Ceci dit, j\u0026rsquo;ai tout de même garder des habitudes de déconnexion numérique.\nMa première année à Berlin a été sans 4G, ce qui était de plus en plus difficile notamment lors des démanagements successifs et pour interagir avec l\u0026rsquo;association que j\u0026rsquo;ai rejoins. Telegram et Whatsapp sont tout simplement monnaie courante et ne pas avoir y accès est sacrément handicapant. De plus, j\u0026rsquo;ai du me résoudre à souscrire à une ligne allemand parce que certains livreurs ou autre services ne pouvait pas me joindre sur mon numéro français. Fin mot de l\u0026rsquo;histoire, j\u0026rsquo;ai réussi à négocier un forfait à 1Go pour quelques euros par mois. Seul quelques applis sont autorisés à accéder au réseau 4G (LTE), notamment les applis de clés numeriques, de messageries et de taxis. Toutes les autres doivent attendre le Wifi afin d\u0026rsquo;accéder à internet.\nLire pour se divertir Ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas un scoop, mais la lecture est un passe temps formidable. J\u0026rsquo;ai découvert la lecture assez tard, à travers mon abonnement papier au Courrier International, que je recommande à tous ceux qui sont curieux de ce qui se passe dans le monde et qui veulent passer du temps hors de leurs écrans. Puis, également à l\u0026rsquo;aide de romans, qui m\u0026rsquo;occupe le soir avant de me coucher.\nFaire moins et prendre le temps Avec du recul, et grace à la pratique du Yoga avec des profs incroyables comme Alex Perez, j\u0026rsquo;ai appris à prendre le temps d\u0026rsquo;apprécier chaque moment. Prendre du temps pour moi, sans toujours chercher à faire plus, ou même faire quelque chose. Moins prévoir et moins faire devient mon fil rouge auquel je me rattache lors que je sens que j\u0026rsquo;en fait trop.\nNaturelement, chaque projet sur lequel je me penche à plus de sens pour moi. C\u0026rsquo;est parce que j\u0026rsquo;y accorde beaucoup d\u0026rsquo;importance.\nMon téléphone n\u0026rsquo;est pas dans ma poche, donc je ne le sors pas en réunion, ou à table avec des amis. Il reste dans ma pochette en cuir lors que je suis dehors, et il a même son petit espace dans l\u0026rsquo;entrée à la maison que j\u0026rsquo;appelle son \u0026ldquo;parking\u0026rdquo;. Je ne l\u0026rsquo;ai pas autorisé dans la chambre.\nLes conversations sont riches et mes pensés soint moins perturbées par une potentielle réponse ou email que je pourrai aperçevoir sur l\u0026rsquo;écran vérrouillé. Ça attendra.\n","permalink":"/fr/posts/desintox_numerique/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"la-norme-être-disponible-partout-et-à-toute-heure\"\u003eLa norme: être disponible partout et à toute heure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMis à jour le 15 févier 2026\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvez-vous déjà eu la sensation de ne plus pouvoir réfléchir à cause d\u0026rsquo;un trop plein d\u0026rsquo;informations ?

Ces entreprises américaines proposent gratuitement des outils géniaux à la pointe de la technologie. Mais à quel prix ?\nPourquoi tant vouloir être indépendant, alors que ces services sont pratiques, rapides et gratuits ? Est-ce si grave d\u0026rsquo;envoyer nos photos, nos informations de rendez-vous et de voyages, nos messages et toutes nos données à ces services ?\nDepuis plus 2020, je me suis mit au défi de prendre mon indépendance à Google. Imaginons que Google change de politique et rendent l\u0026rsquo;accès à tout son contenu payant. Ou qu\u0026rsquo;il décide de vendre à des fins marketing tout le contenu qu\u0026rsquo;on lui a envoyé. Il aurait le droit puisqu\u0026rsquo;on a acceptés les conditions générales de ventes.\nAvec plus ou moins de mal, j\u0026rsquo;ai réussi à échaper aux griffes du géant. Je vais vous expliquer comment j\u0026rsquo;ai fait.\nLe stockage de données C\u0026rsquo;est certainement l\u0026rsquo;outil le plus pratique dans mon quotidien, le cloud Google Drive. 15Go de données gratuitement syncrhonisées sur mon ordinateur et accessibles depuis mon smartphone en un clin d\u0026rsquo;oeil.\nPlutôt que d\u0026rsquo;envoyer mes photos et fichiers dans un Data center, j\u0026rsquo;ai décidé d\u0026rsquo;heberger mon propre NAS. C\u0026rsquo;est donc 16 To de données que j\u0026rsquo;ai monté dans un NAS Synology sur 4 disques dur. Grace aux dernières technologies de réplications de données, je peux perdre un disque sans perdre un seul fichier. Ce qui me coûte environ 15% de l\u0026rsquo;espace totale, mais m\u0026rsquo;offre une certaine serinité.\nSynology a fait un travail remarquable quand à la connectivité sur ses applicaitons iOS et Android. Je peux maintenant consulter à distance mes 2To de photos et vidéos et synchroniser automatiquement toutes mes dernières photos grace à l\u0026rsquo;appli Synology Photos.\nD\u0026rsquo;autres logiciels sont disponibles sur le marketplace comme le calendrier Synology aussi synchronisable à iOS.\nCoût: 700€ Outils abandonnés: Google Drive, Google Photos\nMoteur de recherche Le puissant moteur de recherche Google n\u0026rsquo;a plus de secret pour personne. Après des mois d\u0026rsquo;essais chez la concurrence: Duckduckgo, Ecosia\u0026hellip; C\u0026rsquo;est chez Qant que je me suis arrêté. Les résultats sont meilleurs chaque jours. Pour accompagner ce moteur de recherche j\u0026rsquo;utilise Brave sur ordinateur et mobile. Je le trouve performant et drôlement efficace lors qu\u0026rsquo;il s\u0026rsquo;agit de bloquer les requêtes de tracking.\nTraçage Nous utilisons un grand nombre de logiciels en ligne sans payer quoi que ce soit, ni sans se soucier de comment son traitées nos données. Le tracking permet a une société de capter des informations juteuses afin de les revendre aux intéressées. Il s\u0026rsquo;agit la de vos recherches sur le web, des messages que vous avez échangés avec vos amis, des sites que vous avez consultées, des vidéos que vous avez regardé et même le temps que vous avez passer à regarder une publication Instagram.\nLes carnets d\u0026rsquo;adresses sont revendus au prix fort aux publicitaires qui ciblent leur campagne.\nDes outils qui respectent la vie privée existes (Bravo, Qant) mais pour surfer tranquille sur le net, il faut utiliser des bloqueurs. Ces applis vont bloquer toute une liste de requetes afin qu\u0026rsquo;elle ne quitte pas votre appareil.\nLe plus connu s\u0026rsquo;appelle \u0026ldquo;Lockdown\u0026rdquo;, il fonctionne sur navigateur et sur appli (iOS et android).\nCouriel Afin d\u0026rsquo;en finir avec Google, j\u0026rsquo;ai supprimé tous mes mails sur ma boite Gmail et j\u0026rsquo;ai basculé sur une messagerie OVH avec le client Spark.\nMaps L\u0026rsquo;heureux élu n\u0026rsquo;est autre que Here We Go, une fantastique application qui permet de générer des itinéraires hors-ligne plutôt bien ficelés et même pour vélo !\nAgenda Bye bye Google Agenda, depuis 2 ans je me ballade jamais sans mon agenda de poche et un petit crayon à papier.\nA suivre\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"/fr/posts/technology_alternatives_for_google/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eL\u0026rsquo;empire des GAFAs est tentaculaire.

Le tout sans machine à pain, on va mettre la main à la pate.\nIngrédients pour un pain d'1 kg 580g de farine T65 bio avec une farine de blé ancienne de préférence. Cela permet d\u0026rsquo;avoir un gluten plus fragile, pour une meilleure digestion. Il faut aussi faire attention a petrir doucement la pate pour ne pas casser le gluten. 430g d\u0026rsquo;eau source 12g de sel 300g de levain ou 25g de levure déshydratée Ce qui nous fait une pate à pain hydratée à 74% d\u0026rsquo;eau.\nPour un plus petit pain 40% plus petit:\n350g de farine 258g d\u0026rsquo;eau 8g de sel Pour un pain plus gros avec 1kg de farine:\n1000g de farine 740g d\u0026rsquo;eau 20g de sel Pétrissage a la main Laisser reposer 30 min, puis faire des tours (soulever pâte sur elle même avec les mains mouillées). Laisser reposer 3h, puis façonner la pate (façonnage: retirer l\u0026rsquo;air, former un paton en boule avec 3 plis) Laisser reposer 3h, puis fariner et enfourer. A cette étape on peut le scarifier pour qu\u0026rsquo;il s\u0026rsquo;ouvre correctement.\nCuisson L\u0026rsquo;étape crussiale pour finir notre pain maison. Le mieux est de placer le pain fariné dans une marmite en fonte (ou Dutch oven) au préalable placée au four. Je n\u0026rsquo;ai pas de marmite en fonte, donc j\u0026rsquo;utilise deux plats en Pyrex qui s\u0026rsquo;emboitent.\nSinon, on peut aussi mettre le pain sur un plaque de cuisson et aposer au fond du four un casserole pleine d\u0026rsquo;eau.\nLe but est de garder un pain assez humide pendant la cuisson pour qu\u0026rsquo;il puisse gonfler tranquillement.\nPain complets On peut également mélanger les farines, je conseille de tester la farine de sarrasin, seigle, épeautre. Le pain complet lève moins, mais il sera riche en fibre.\n","permalink":"/fr/posts/cooking_pain_maison/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAprès plusieurs tentatives et une dizaines de cuissons, je vous présente ma recette préférée.\nLe tout sans machine à pain, on va mettre la main à la pate.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Faire son pain maison"},{"content":"Présentation Je suis développeur web senior, actuellement chez Ninox Software (plateforme low-code), où je travaille sur les fonctionnalités frontend des applications web et desktop.\nDe 2019 à 2024, j\u0026rsquo;ai travaillé à la Société Générale sur les fonctionnalités Carte Bancaire des applications mobiles et desktop, utilisées par plus de 4 millions d\u0026rsquo;utilisateurs.\nEn 2018-2019, j\u0026rsquo;étais alternant en Recherche \u0026amp; Développement chez Axway, tout en étudiant à l\u0026rsquo;IIM (Institut de l\u0026rsquo;Internet et du Multimédia).\nJe suis également développeur web freelance et j\u0026rsquo;accompagne différents clients — indépendants, start-ups, entreprises — dans la création et la maintenance de sites web et d\u0026rsquo;applications mobiles.\nDepuis 2014, j\u0026rsquo;ai développé et géré de nombreux projets web, en coordonnant designers, développeurs et marketeurs.\nPendant mon temps libre, je m\u0026rsquo;occupe du site et anime ma propre émission sur les webradios Radio Sofa et THF Radio.\nContact Pour me joindre, merci d\u0026rsquo;utiliser cet identifiant sur les différents réseaux sociaux @janastasiamusic\nTelegram pour m\u0026rsquo;envoyer un message Instagram pour suivres mon compte artiste Soundcloud pour écouter mes derniers mix Paypal 💸 Contenu du site Vous trouverez sur ce site l\u0026rsquo;avancement de mes side projects, mes réflexions et quelques réalisations culinaires !\n","permalink":"/fr/posts/about/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"présentation\"\u003ePrésentation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJe suis développeur web senior, actuellement chez \u003ca href='https://ninox.com'\u003eNinox Software\u003c/a\u003e (plateforme low-code), où je travaille sur les fonctionnalités frontend des applications web et desktop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe 2019 à 2024, j\u0026rsquo;ai travaillé à la Société Générale sur les fonctionnalités Carte Bancaire des applications mobiles et desktop, utilisées par plus de 4 millions d\u0026rsquo;utilisateurs.\u003cbr\u003e\nEn 2018-2019, j\u0026rsquo;étais alternant en Recherche \u0026amp; Développement chez Axway, tout en étudiant à l\u0026rsquo;\u003ca href='https://iim.fr'\u003eIIM (Institut de l\u0026rsquo;Internet et du Multimédia)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJe suis également développeur web freelance et j\u0026rsquo;accompagne différents clients — indépendants, start-ups, entreprises — dans la création et la maintenance de sites web et d\u0026rsquo;applications mobiles.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Timothée Dorand"}]
