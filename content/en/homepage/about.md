## What do you do for a living?

Hi, my name is Timothée, I am a web developper, working at Société Générale on the mobile app and desktop Bank Card features.
In 2018-2019, I was a working student in Research and Development at Axway as developer and student at the IIM (Institut de l'Internet et du Multimédia).

Also freelance web developer and work with various customers: self-employed, start-ups, companies, building and maintaining websites or mobile applications.

You will find on this site the progress of my side-projects, my reflexions and other culinary achievements!
