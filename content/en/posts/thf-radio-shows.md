In ‘The Concave Side of the Spoon’ residency, I explore the rhythms and percussion of traditional music and its influence on contemporary music. It's like looking at the reflection of the spoon and seing our world in reverse, taking a step back form the music I play, leading me to a different approach to music.

### Avant-Garde Jazz from Chicago to Contemporary Jazz - January 11th 2026

In this episode I dive into the amazing world of Jazz and avant-garde jazz born in Chicago. In this movement, the artists are improvising and playing with free jazz ideas and experiment with it. What I really like about the artists I featured, is the use of electronic sounds or very specific rythms and drums technique, sounding like smooth jazz, very pleasing to listen to.
In the last part, I'm playing more recent jazz and electronic releases (2025), showing how it got influenced by their ancestors.

#### Context & History

- **Geography:**  
  The Congo region is split between two countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa, ex-Zaire, Belgian colony) and the Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville, French colony). The capitals, Kinshasa and Brazzaville, sit across from each other on the Congo River, making them the world’s closest capitals.
- **Cultural & Musical Roots:**  
  Despite shared ethnic groups and river, each country developed distinct musical identities due to their colonial histories and economic differences.  
  The DRC is famed for its mineral wealth and musical innovation, while Congo-Brazzaville is known for oil and vibrant urban culture.
- **Musical Evolution:**  
  - **1940s–60s:** The birth and golden age of Congolese rumba, with artists like Wendo Kolosoy, Joseph Kabasele (Grand Kallé), African Jazz, and OK Jazz (Franco Luambo, Vicky Longomba).
  - **1970s–90s:** Big bands (Zaïko, Stukas), the rise of soukous, and political changes affecting music scenes.
  - **Modern Era:** Contemporary artists like Fally Ipupa and Ferre Gola continue to innovate, while genres like soukous, ndombolo, and electronic fusions thrive.

#### Influences & Connections

- **Pan-African & Global:**  
  Congolese music has influenced and been influenced by Benga (Kenya), Champeta (Colombia), and funk, jazz, and electronic music worldwide.
- **Women in Tradition:**  
  *Stella Chiweshe* broke gender barriers as Africa’s most famous female mbira player, blending Zimbabwean tradition with global sounds.
- **Percussion Power:**  
  *Les Tambours de Brazza* (Congo-Brazzaville) blend traditional ngoma drums with modern instruments, representing the region’s rhythmic diversity.
- **Highlife & Afrobeat:**  
  *Ebo Taylor* (Ghana) and *Oghene Kologbo* (Nigeria) show the cross-pollination of West African highlife, afrobeat, and Congolese rumba.

### Jazz & Drum&Bass - April 6th 2025

In this residency, I explore the rhythms and percussion of traditional music and its influence on contemporary music. It's like looking at the reflection of a spoon and seeing our world in reverse, taking a step back form the music I play, leading me to a different approach to music.

In today's episode, we'll dive into Jazz music and its extraordinary drumming section. 

We will first have a look a jazz pioneers like Art Blakey, Louie Bellson, Gene Krupa, Clifford Brown, Buddie Rich and modern jazzman like Medeksi, Martin and Wood.

In the second part of the show, we'll explore how it influenced the Drum and Bass of Ornette Hawkins, Amon Tobin, Earl Grey, Calibre and many more.
