In ‘The Concave Side of the Spoon’ residency, I explore the rhythms and percussion of traditional music and its influence on contemporary music. It's like looking at the reflection of the spoon and seing our world in reverse, taking a step back form the music I play, leading me to a different approach to music.

This special episode with Davy is a journey through the history, geography, and influence of African drums, focusing on the Congo region and its musical diaspora.

This show is a celebration of the Congo’s deep rhythmic heritage, its influence across Africa and the world, and the ongoing innovation of African percussion. From the golden age of rumba and soukous to modern electronic and afro-punk fusions, the episode highlights both the roots and the future of African drums. Special attention is given to the role of women, the impact of colonial histories, and the creative resilience of artists who continue to shape global music.

#### Context & History

- **Geography:**  
  The Congo region is split between two countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa, ex-Zaire, Belgian colony) and the Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville, French colony). The capitals, Kinshasa and Brazzaville, sit across from each other on the Congo River, making them the world’s closest capitals.
- **Cultural & Musical Roots:**  
  Despite shared ethnic groups and river, each country developed distinct musical identities due to their colonial histories and economic differences.  
  The DRC is famed for its mineral wealth and musical innovation, while Congo-Brazzaville is known for oil and vibrant urban culture.
- **Musical Evolution:**  
  - **1940s–60s:** The birth and golden age of Congolese rumba, with artists like Wendo Kolosoy, Joseph Kabasele (Grand Kallé), African Jazz, and OK Jazz (Franco Luambo, Vicky Longomba).
  - **1970s–90s:** Big bands (Zaïko, Stukas), the rise of soukous, and political changes affecting music scenes.
  - **Modern Era:** Contemporary artists like Fally Ipupa and Ferre Gola continue to innovate, while genres like soukous, ndombolo, and electronic fusions thrive.

#### Influences & Connections

- **Pan-African & Global:**  
  Congolese music has influenced and been influenced by Benga (Kenya), Champeta (Colombia), and funk, jazz, and electronic music worldwide.
- **Women in Tradition:**  
  *Stella Chiweshe* broke gender barriers as Africa’s most famous female mbira player, blending Zimbabwean tradition with global sounds.
- **Percussion Power:**  
  *Les Tambours de Brazza* (Congo-Brazzaville) blend traditional ngoma drums with modern instruments, representing the region’s rhythmic diversity.
- **Highlife & Afrobeat:**  
  *Ebo Taylor* (Ghana) and *Oghene Kologbo* (Nigeria) show the cross-pollination of West African highlife, afrobeat, and Congolese rumba.

A brief description of the artists played in this mix:
- Steve Reich American composer best known as a pioneer of minimal music in the mid to late 1960s
- Sub Dub: The pioneering experimental dub duo Sub Dub, were active between 1992-1998 in NYC, produced by Badawi aka Ghost Producer and John Ward, credited as being the catalyst for the so called "illbient" scene, predating Dub Step by over a decade.
- Woob: is the stage name of Paul Frankland, an English composer, musician and filmmaker who started recording in the early 1990s. Woob's albums combine elements of ambient, downtempo and space music, with samples from field recordings. Frankland has also recorded under the names of Journeyman and Max & Harvey.
- Adham Shaikh is a composer, record producer and sound designer living near Nelson, British Columbia. The 21st-century rituals of dance and chill-out have drawn Shaikh to explore the trance phenomenon that these different expressions of music create and allow. Over the years, Shaikh has worked with musicians playing musical instruments from India; Bali, Indonesia; Africa; Scandinavia; Turkey; the United States; and Canada.
- Muslimgauze was the main musical project of Bryn Jones (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British ethnic electronica and experimental musician who was influenced by conflicts and history in the Muslim world, often with an emphasis on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never achieved mainstream success. His music has been described by one critic as "among the most startling and unique in the noise underground.
- Jonaz Joslen: Martinique: sound designer, beatmaker composer and songwriter, also director of documentaries from french caribbean.
- Klé La: Fervent contributeur de la culture guadeloupéenne, Klé La est ce que l'on appelle un Groupe a Po. Ces groupes à Po sont des groupes faisant partie du carnaval.

- Tino Corp. is a record label dedicated to curating unique beats and sounds that are not available from any other source.
- Jah Wobble is an English bass guitarist and singer. He became known to a wider audience as the original bass player in Public Image Ltd (PiL) in the late 1970s ...
- Julio "Chocolate" Algendones is one of the essential percussionists in the great tradition of Afro-Peruvian music.

---- 

I’m Jan Astasia, member of Radio Sofa, a web radio based in Paris. Let me present my new show on THF. I wanted to explore the music with percussion, play with tradition music and how they influence the electronic music of today.
