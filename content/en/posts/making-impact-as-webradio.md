I’m Jan Astasia, member of Radio Sofa, a web radio based in Paris and resident at THF Radio in Berlin. I've recently hosted a workshop at TNP Radio's event in Amsterdam and I wanted to share what I gathered.


# Making a Positive Impact on the World with an Online Radio Platform
Online radio stations are musical playgrounds for both upcoming and established talent. But anyone who has been closely following the established platforms like NTS, Kiosk Radio, or Radio TNP will agree that these platforms represent much more. In this article, we'll discuss how online radio platforms can make a positive impact on the world. 

First, let's take a look at examples of impactful projects done by radio stations across the world.

## Examples of Impactful Projects

- **NTS**: Hosted a "musique de silence" event in solidarity with the genocide in Gaza.
- **HÖR**: Controversially censored pro-Palestine apparel.
- **LOT Radio**: Organized the "Resistance Stream" to support Palestine Mutual Aid.
- **Radio alHara**: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change.
- **Refuge Worldwide & Root Radio**: Fundraisers for Lebanon and Gaza.

## Group Workshop
### Meaningful ideas to address societal issues or challenges

#### Empower Local Communities
1. **Create a new show hosted by Radio Team**
   - Promote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote)
   - Give a voice to minorities

2. **Find a journalist to create a residency**
   - Show a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture

#### Activism: Education before Fund Raising
1. **Share more Educational content**
   - Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies
   - Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money
   - It's important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time.

#### Activism: Freedom of Speech
Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.

1. **Use the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities**
   - If they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice

2. **Create or be a relay for content**
   - Help people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don't know where to start. Who should they trust? Who's really independent - saying the truth?

#### Finance the Radio Studio / Station
1. **Public funding**
   - How to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things.

2. **Self-funding**
   - Try not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events.

### Introduction to Radio Sofa
Radio Sofa is a collective set up in April 2020, originally as a web radio station. The idea was to continue broadcasting current and electronic music while cultural venues had to stay silent. Our activities have now expanded to include traditional radio broadcasting, production of festive and meditative events, visual arts, and micro-collections of clothing and cassettes.

### Mission and Values
Radio Sofa creates a space of expression for artists and discovery for the audience. We are committed to pioneering and inclusive programming, showcasing emerging artists with diverse identities and valuing risk-taking and creation. We also aim to minimize the environmental impact of our activities by programming local artists and prioritizing soft mobility and second-hand materials.
