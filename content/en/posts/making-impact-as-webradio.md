I’m Jan Astasia, member of Radio Sofa, a web radio based in Paris and resident at THF Radio in Berlin. I've recently hosted a workshop at TNP Radio's event in Amsterdam and I wanted to share what I gathered.

Online radio stations are musical playgrounds for both upcoming and established talent. But anyone who has been closely following the established platforms like NTS, Kiosk Radio, or Radio TNP will agree that these platforms represent much more. In this article, we'll discuss how online radio platforms can make a positive impact on the world. 

First, let's take a look at examples of impactful projects done by radio stations across the world.

# Examples of Impactful Projects
## Geo-Political Debates

### Genocide in Gaza / Assault in Lebanon

**LOT Radio**: Organized the "Resistance Stream" to support Palestine Mutual Aid <sup>[^1]</sup> <sup>[^2]</sup>.

**Radio alHara**: Broadcasts from Bethlehem, focusing on social change <sup>[^3]</sup> <sup>[^4]</sup> 
The mixtape Learning Palestine Until Liberation is a 12 hours sound program created from content downloaded from Youtube “interweaving songs, poems, music, chants, talks, discussions, presentations, and conversations by many, many singers, intellectuals, academics, researchers, musicians, students, and fighters to teach, tell, inform, and to understand the history, the present, and reality of the ongoing struggle for justice and liberation for Palestine” <sup>[^5]</sup>liberation-radio-alhara-12-hours-program-on-palestine)

The radio is also active in collecting clothing for the homeless in our studio, collecting laptops for Ukrainian refugees, fundraising money for Gaza, Syria/Turkey + for a music school in Palestine. In Brazil we helped build a football school by raising over €28k. We did campaigns to motivate the younger generation to vote during elections. Recently we also did a radio workshop for refugees.

**Root Radio**: Calling for a strike for all musicians <sup>[^9]</sup>

### Invasion of Ukraine

**Refuge Worldwide**: From solidarity party series to community radio(https://refugeworldwide.com/). Refuge was started as a fundraising platform working in solidarity with grassroots and non-profit organisations. In January 2021 we launched Refuge Worldwide, a new radio station to amplify the music and issues that we care about, broadcasting 24/7 from Weserstraße 166, (12045 Berlin Neukölln).

**Reminiscing Our Land: A fundraiser by Root Radio & Refuge Worldwide** <sup>[^10]</sup>

 On November 2nd 2024, Root Radio and Refuge Worldwide will once again collaborate on an event to raise funds for the ongoing assault on Lebanon and Gaza. The event, which takes place at a secret "multidisciplinary venue" in Berlin, also aims to provide a space for collective reflection and raising awareness. Over 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes, and thousands killed, since Israel has escalated its attacks on Lebanon throughout the past month. Lebanon is now suffering from a nationwide humanitarian crisis, while the situation in neighbouring Palestine also continues to worsen each day. Starting from 3PM and running until 2AM, Reminiscing Our Land will feature a number of live performances and listening sessions, as well as an art market, food and a screening of On Thyme Hills (a documentary about resistant ecologies in London, Lebanon, and Palestine). Musical contributions come from Abadir, Nour Sokhon, Dakn, Peter Kirn, Q, Marylou, Lateef & VEX, Joumana, Sunfear & Lawrence Goodwin, Aalia & Azemad, and Root Radio founder Ahmadshk. The arts and merch sale will include pieces from Aliaa Kurdi, Hildashaus, Sina Opalka, Space Of Urgency, Suhail Nassar + Moayed Abu Ammouna and Diaspora Rising, as well as a vinyl sale organised by Refuge and its resident artists. Entry will be by donation - minimum 10€ is suggested - but nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. All proceeds from the event will be donated to a small number of trusted groups working on the ground in Lebanon and Palestine, including a trusted individual facilitating aid and ambulance visits, and organisations supporting migrant workers in Lebanon.

**Grains of Peace**: Except for guns and bombs, the main weapons of the enemy are fear and anxiety. They poison our thoughts, destroy our strength, and oppress our hearts. We believe that music is an instrument of peace, a medicine, whose power can be felt by everyone and can help to find faith, hope, and peace in this world again. We invite artists from all over the world to sow grains of peace to support the spirit of our country, fill souls with light, and fill the future with meaning. Listen to music and stand with Ukraine.  <sup>[^19]</sup>

**Mystrictrax**: Ukrainian Experimental Laboratory of Sound

Kyiv labels Standard Deviation and Mystictrax came together for a charity compilation featuring 65 Ukrainian and international artists, including Laurent Garnier, Alinka and Héctor Oaks. "It's probably a very strange decision, to [put together] a release during the shelling and the war, but I just didn't know what else I could do," said Mystictrax head Lostlojic. "Sasha Zakrevska (AKA Poly Chain) wrote to me, 'let's put together a compilation,' and we immediately started contacting everyone we knew. Eventually, we joined forces with Standard Deviation, the Modern Matters agency and others. Everyone was keen to get involved. It was probably the best thing I could have done during this time, and I am very proud of this project.”

 
**Café Político Radio**: Based in Colombia, this station discusses Latin American politics, including regional geopolitical developments1.

**Front électronique**: Involved in political debates during French legislative elections.

> In preparation for the legislative elections, a movement in the electronic music industry was created, the Electronic Front, to respond with one voice to the rise of the extreme right. The movement brings together 38 artists in the compilation “Siamo Tutti Antifascti”, which is above all a call for mobilization. Faced with an ideology that threatens the independence of the cultural sector and individual freedoms, the Electronist Front recalls that the defence of freedoms through artistic creation will never die.

### Promoting Sustainability
**Radio Sofa**: Upcycles clothes, promoting sustainable fashion.
Radio Sofa is a collective set up in April 2020, originally as a web radio station. The idea was to continue broadcasting current and electronic music while cultural venues had to stay silent. Our activities have now expanded to include traditional radio broadcasting, production of festive and meditative events, visual arts, and micro-collections of clothing and cassettes.

Radio Sofa creates a space of expression for artists and discovery for the audience. We are committed to pioneering and inclusive programming, showcasing emerging artists with diverse identities and valuing risk-taking and creation. We also aim to minimize the environmental impact of our activities by programming local artists and prioritizing soft mobility and second-hand materials.

# Conclusion

What can we do as Media or Radio Platform? Here are some meaningful actions you can take to address societal issues or challenges.

## Empower Local Communities
**Create a new show hosted by Radio Team**
Promote local artists (from record shops, artists that can’t auto-promote)
Give a voice to minorities

**Find a journalist to create a residency**
Show a flavor of normal life experience in another country/culture

## Activism: Education before Fund Raising
**Share more Educational content**
Interviews, mixtapes, shows, residencies
Teaching about geo-political conflicts and the actual lives of people is more important than raising money
It's important that the people giving money are aware and engaged. So they can do it by themselves instead of waiting for something in return from a fundraising event ticket, like a great party/fun time.

## Activism: Freedom of Speech
Web Radios are good for democracy and giving resources to artists. They are a great opportunity to avoid social media and big corporations and keep the freedom of speech.

**Use the radio station as a relay for people threatened by local authorities**
If they talk about some subjects, they can use an independent radio station to use their voice

**Create or be a relay for content**
Help people find ways to demonstrate, to be more engaged, like facilitators. People are sometimes interested in being more engaged and being more activists, but they don't know where to start. Who should they trust? Who's really independent - saying the truth?

## Finance the Radio Studio / Station
**Public funding**
How to deal with funding cuts in the Netherlands and in Germany? Talking about it and sharing potential solutions seems to change things.

**Self-funding**
Try not to be too greedy, avoid capitalistic private investors, have a small business like a cafe/bar, shop, gallery/expo, event space or make money organizing events.
