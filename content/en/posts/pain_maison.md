After several attempts and dozens of bakings, I present you my favorite recipe. All of this without a bread maker!

## Ingredients for a 1 kg bread
- 580g of organic T65 flour 
- 430g of spring water
- 12g of salt
- 300g of sourdough or 25g of dehydrated yeast

This makes a bread dough with 74% water content.

## Kneading by hand
- 30 min - turn (lift dough on itself with wet hand)
- 3h - shaping
- 3h - flouring and baking 

For a 40% smaller loaf 
- 350g flour
- 258g water
- 8g of salt

## Baking

T his is the most important step to finish our homemade bread. 
The best way to do this is to place the floured bread in a cast iron (or Dutch oven) pot that has been placed in the oven.
I don't have a cast iron pot, so I use two Pyrex dishes that fit together.

Alternatively, you can put the bread on a baking sheet and place a pan full of water in the bottom of the oven.

The goal is to keep the bread moist enough during the baking process so that it can rise slowly.

## Wholemeal bread

You can also mix flours, I advise to try buckwheat, rye, spelt flour.
The wholemeal bread rises less, but it will be rich in fiber.
