## About

I am a Senior Web Developer, currently working at Ninox Software—a low-code platform—where I focus on frontend features for both the app and desktop versions.

From 2019 to 2024, I worked at Société Générale (French bank) on the mobile app and desktop Bank Card features, serving over 4 million users.  
In 2018–2019, I was a working student in Research and Development at Axway, while studying at IIM (Institut de l'Internet et du Multimédia).

I also work as a freelance web developer, collaborating with a variety of clients—self-employed professionals, start-ups, and companies—building and maintaining websites and mobile applications.

Since 2014, I have developed and managed numerous web projects, coordinating designers, developers, and marketers.

In my spare time, I manage the website and host my own show for the webradios Radio Sofa and THF Radio.
