## Présentation

I'm a fullstack web developer, graduated from IIM in 2019 and responsible for the online bank card area at Société Générale until 2024. Since 2024, I've been part of the development team at <a href=‘https://ninox.com’>Ninox</a>, a Berlin start-up.
<br/>
In my spare time, I manage the website and program my own show for the webradio Radio Sofa and THF Radio.
